`thunderboard-sltb001a`
----------------------

This is a board support crate for the [Silicon Labs Thunderboard Sense] "inspiration kit".

The part designation is a bit odd; while there is now a revision B to the
board, it is not referred to as "sltb001b" on the vendor page, and rarely as
"sltb001".

All known (up to B02) revisions feature a EFR32MG1P132F256GM48 controller (with
2.4GHz radio for Bluetooth and 802.15.4). Additional peripherals on the board
include a MEMS microphone, as well as light, inetial and various air sensors,
complemented by the obligatory LEDs and buttons.
